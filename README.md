# Income Expense Tracker using Python + NoSQL

We all have wanted to keep track of our monthly income and expenses in a very simplistic way but didn't want to use Excel Sheets. Expense Tracker leverages the power of Python and the streamlit open source library to build an interactive web application to solve this purpose. In order to store our monthly reports and data we will use a FREE NoSQL Database from Deta (https://deta.sh). For the visualisation part of the monthly spendings, we will use Sankey Charts from Plotly. 

Note: Expense Tracker includes a fully functional frontend, don't forget to try it!!

Thank-you:))
